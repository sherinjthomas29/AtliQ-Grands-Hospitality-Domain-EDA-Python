## **üéØ Project Description**

**Situation**

AtliQ Grands experienced declining revenue and market share in the competitive hospitality sector, lacking data-driven insights to understand booking patterns and optimize performance across properties and channels.

**Task**
Analyze booking data from official website and third-party platforms to identify revenue drivers, occupancy patterns, and performance gaps across cities, room categories, and time periods to support strategic decision-making.

**Action**

--> Performed comprehensive data exploration and cleaning on 134,590+ booking records
--> Removed outliers using statistical methods (mean ¬± 3*std) and handled missing data (57.9% ratings missing)
--> Analyzed occupancy rates across room categories, cities, and day types (weekday vs weekend)
--> Calculated revenue metrics by city, month, and property category
--> Created visualizations using Matplotlib for stakeholder presentation
--> Merged multiple datasets (bookings, hotels, rooms, dates) for holistic analysis

**Result**

Generated actionable insights revealing:

--> Occupancy patterns: Presidential rooms highest at 59.30%, Standard lowest at 58.22%
--> Revenue distribution: Identified top-performing cities and seasonal trends
--> Booking channel analysis: Direct vs third-party platform performance
--> Monthly revenue trends showing decline from May (‚Çπ347M) to July (‚Çπ330M)
